# Wrecktangle Window Gnome extension

Position window like [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) in Gnome!

## Installation

Clone this repository with git and do a `make install` to install it 
in your `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions` directory.

## Settings

Shortcuts can be modified in the preferences. By default, they use the default Rectangle shortcuts

## Acknowledgement

Most of that code comes from the [One Third Window](https://github.com/chmouel/one-third-window-gnome-extension)
extension but adds more options for how the windows are positioned and sized.
